<a name="scan">Any barcode scanner that emulates the keyboard is supported 
by OpenBiblio.</a> 
This includes USB scanners and scanners that connect between the computer 
and its keyboard (keyboard wedge).
<br>
Most barcode scanners can be programmed to automatically append a carriage 
return (same as hitting ENTER on the keyboard) to every scan. In this way, 
OpenBiblio will be able to process your request as soon as you scan the item.
